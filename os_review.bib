@article{Meyer2016,
abstract = {Contemporary models of behavioral regulation maintain that balanced activity between cognitive control areas (prefrontal cortex, PFC) and subcortical reward-related regions (nucleus accumbens, NAC) mediates the selection of appropriate behavioral responses, whereas imbalanced activity (PFCÂ {\textless} NAC) results in maladaptive behavior [1-6]. Imbalance can arise from reduced engagement of PFC (via fatigue or stress [7]) or from excessive activity in NAC [8]. Additionally, a concept far less researched is that an imbalance can result from simultaneously low PFC activity and high NAC activity. This occurs during adolescence, when the maturation of PFC lags behind that of NAC and NAC is more functionally active compared to adulthood or pre-adolescence [2, 5, 9, 10]. Accordingly, activity is disproportionately higher in NAC than in PFC, which may contribute to impulsivity and risk-taking exhibited by adolescents [5, 6, 10-12]. Despite having explanatory value, support for this notion has been solely correlational. Here, we causally tested this using chemogenetics to simultaneously decrease neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and increase activity in NAC in adult rats, mimicking the imbalance during adolescence. We tested the effects on negative occasion setting, an important yet understudied form of inhibitory learning that may be particularly relevant during adolescence. Rats with combined manipulation of OFC and NAC were impaired in learning to use environmental cues to withhold a response, an effect that was greater than that of either manipulation alone. These findings provide direct evidence that simultaneous underactivity in OFC and overactivity in NAC can negatively impact behavioral control and provide insight into the neural systems that underlie inhibitory learning.},

@article{Delamater2007,
abstract = {A wide variety of associative learning tasks have been employed to assess the functional role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and related structures in learning. Many of these tasks were designed to assess the learning of highly specific associations between Pavlovian conditioned stimuli (or instrumental responses) and the sensory properties of reinforcement (i.e., sensory-specific associations). Current research suggests that OFC lesions impair behavioral control by these sensory-specific associations in unconditioned stimulus (US) devaluation, differential outcome, and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer experiments. In addition, although the OFC has been shown to be important in conditioned reinforcement but not in potentiated feeding tasks, versions of these tasks that assess control by sensory-specific associations have either not been run or they have not examined the effects of OFC lesions. Thus, firm conclusions from conditioned reinforcement and potentiated feeding studies cannot yet be drawn. Furthermore, studies examining the OFC's involvement in reversal learning have also suggested that associations between stimuli and reinforcement importantly depend upon a functioning OFC, possibly because this structure is needed to generate outcome expectancies useful in the computation of prediction errors ultimately used to "update" associations elsewhere (e.g., basolateral amygdala). Other work has shown that both original and reversed sensory-specific associations can control performance after different time delays following reversal learning. This suggests that structures outside of the OFC may be involved in the storage of originally acquired associations. Overall, this review makes clear that the OFC plays an important role in the encoding of sensory-specific associations in a wide variety of learning tasks.},

@book{Bouton2007,
abstract = {Book Description: The considerable progress that has been made researching fundamental learning processes tells an important and interesting story. In this new book written for undergraduates, graduate students, and curious professionals Mark Bouton recounts that story, providing a strong background in modern learning and behavior theory that is informed by the history of the field. The text reflects the author's conviction that the study of animal learning has a central place in psychology, and that understanding its principles and theories is important for students, psychologists, and scientists in related disciplines (e.g., behavioral neuroscience and clinical psychology). Almost all of the chapters are organized to illustrate how knowledge is accumulated through the systematic development of theory and research. The book opens with a brief history that connects the modern issues with their philosophical and biological roots. The second chapter addresses the idea that basic learning processes are designed to help an organism adapt to a changing world; in the process, it introduces the reader to a wide range of interesting examples of learning. After analyzing some fundamental phenomena in Pavlovian learning, the book then provides a very clear and readable review of modern conditioning theories since the Rescorla-Wagner model, discusses memory retrieval and behavior-system processes that govern performance, and addresses the question (posed by research in the late 1960s and 1970s) of whether the laws of learning and behavior uncovered in the laboratory maze and Skinner box have generality by studying learning in honey bees and categorization and causal judgments in humans. Instrumental learning is then discussed from various perspectives in chapters on behavior and its consequences (research in behavior analysis), how stimuli guide instrumental action (a survey of the field of animal cognition), and how motivation influences instrumental action. The final chapter reviews and integrates the major themes of the book, describing avoidance learning, learned helplessness, and related examples of learning before reviewing the modern cognitive and synthetic perspective on instrumental action. Lively and current, Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis engages students while illustrating the interconnectedness and excitement of modern research.

abstract = {This study was undertaken to investigate the associative process underlying serial feature positive conditional discrimination learning (X--{\textgreater}A+/A-) and the role of the hippocampus in the solution of tasks demanding a configural association strategy such as the negative patterning discrimination (XA-/X+/A+). It has been suggested that the hippocampus is essential for the learning of complex tasks, so, it is expected that hippocampal lesions would prove equally detrimental to performance in both tasks, but would not interfere with simple discrimination learning. Hippocampal lesions were made with X-radiation exposure to neonate rats after completion of a parametric study 'J. Neurosci. Methods 75 (1997) 41' that established the best radiation parameters to selectively lesion the hippocampal dentate gyrus. When adults, rats were submitted to a serial feature positive conditional discrimination task with the trials 'House light/Tone: water (H--{\textgreater}T+)', 'Tone: no water (T-)', and two simple discrimination with the trials 'Clicker: water (C+)' and 'Noise: no water (N-)' in Experiment I. In Experiment II, adult rats, irradiated and control, were submitted to the negative patterning task with the trials 'House light/Tone: no water (HT-)', 'House light: water (H+)', 'Tone: water (T+)', and to the non-conditional discrimination with the trial Noise: no water (N-)'. In contrast to the expectation of impaired performance in these tasks by lesioned rats, animals with damage to the hippocampal dentate gyrus learned the complex and the simple tasks as well as control subjects. These results suggest that the dentate gyrus does not participate directly in the modulation of acquisition of tasks demanding a complex strategy of occasion setting in procedures of serial conditional discrimination or a configural strategy, important for the negative patterning discrimination solution.},

The first part reviews evidence that extinction does not destroy the original learning, but instead generates new learning that is especially context-dependent. The second part examines insights provided by research on several related behavioral phenomena (the interference paradigms, conditioned inhibition, and inhibition despite reinforcement). The final part examines four potential causes of extinction: the discrimination of a new reinforcement rate, generalization decrement, response inhibition, and violation of a reinforcer expectation. The data are consistent with behavioral models that emphasize the role of generalization decrement and expectation violation, but would be more so if those models were expanded to better accommodate the finding that extinction involves a context-modulated form of inhibitory learning.},

abstract = {Four appetitive conditioning experiments studied generalization between compound conditional stimuli (AB) and their elements (e.g., A or B). In Experiments 1 and 2, rats received conditioning with A and AB, and then extinction with either A or AB. During subsequent testing, there was more generalization of extinction (nonresponding) from the compound (AB) to the element (A) than from the element (A) to the compound (AB). This asymmetry was consistent with earlier results involving temporal discrimination learning in which short and long temporal intervals played the roles of A and AB. In Experiment 3, rats received conditioning with either A or AB, and then testing with A and AB. Consistent with elemental models of conditioning, there was more generalization of conditioned responding from A to AB than from AB to A. Experiment 4 found that these asymmetries in the generalization of extinction (Experiments 1 and 2) and conditioning (Experiment 3) both contribute to the feature-positive effect. Overall, the parallel between the current findings and previous results with temporal discrimination learning supports an associative analysis of interval timing. Implications for elemental and configural theories of conditioning and generalization are also discussed.},

abstract = {Psychologists and neurobiologists have a long-standing interest in understanding how the context surrounding the events of our lives is represented and how it influences our behavior. The hippocampal formation emerged very early as a major contributor to how context is represented and functions. There is a large literature examining its contribution that on the surface reveals an array of conflicting outcomes and controversy. This review reveals that these conflicts can be resolved by building Nadel and Willner's dual-process theory of context representations. Two general conclusions emerge: (1) There are two neural systems that can support context representations and functions-a neocortical system composed primarily of perirhinal and postrhinal cortices and a hippocampal system that includes perirhinal, postrhinal, entorhinal cortices, and the hippocampal formation. (2) These two systems are not equivalent-some context representations and functions are uniquely supported by the hippocampal system. These conclusions are discussed in the context of canonical ideas about the special properties of the hippocampal system that enable it to make unique contributions to memory.},

abstract = {Two experiments examined transfer of stimulus control after discrete-trial operant serial feature positive discrimination (X ??? A+ A-) training in rats. Transfer of the X feature's ability to facilitate responding to a subsequent target cue was nearly complete if the transfer target had been trained as the target in another serial feature positive discrimination, even if that target controlled a different operant than controlled by the original A target. Repeated presentations of X alone had little effect on performance to either the original or transfer test compounds. In contrast, transfer to a separately trained and extinguished target was smaller and occurred only if the original and transfer target controlled the same operant. Furthermore that transfer was eliminated by nonreinforced feature presentations. Implications of these data for hypotheses about the nature of occasion setting in operant conditioning were discussed. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {We present a Bayesian statistical theory of context learning in the rodent hippocampus. While context is often defined in an experimental setting in relation to specific background cues or task demands, we advance a single, more general notion of context that suffices for a variety of learning phenomena. Specifically, a context is defined as a statistically stationary distribution of experiences, and context learning is defined as the problem of how to form contexts out of groups of experiences that cluster together in time. The challenge of context learning is solving the model selection problem: How many contexts make up the rodent's world? Solving this problem requires balancing two opposing goals: minimize the variability of the distribution of experiences within a context and minimize the likelihood of transitioning between contexts. The theory provides an understanding of why hippocampal place cell remapping sometimes develops gradually over many days of experience and why even consistent landmark d...},

abstract = {Four experiments in rats examined whether occasion setters and target CSs play qualitatively different roles in occasion-setting discriminations. Two visual occasion setters, A and B, signalled reinforcement of two auditory target CSs, x and y, with sucrose and oil (A{\ldots}xâsuc, B{\ldots}yâoil, A-, B-, x-, y-); in addition two transfer CSs w and z were paired with sucrose and oil (wâsuc, zâoil). When w and z were substituted for x and y (A{\ldots}w, B{\ldots}w, A{\ldots}z, B{\ldots}z) more responding was observed when both stimuli had been paired with the same outcome (Experiments 1 and 3a). No effect was observed when two visual "pseudo-occasion setters", C and D (paired with sucrose and oil in a trace relation to the US:C{\ldots}âsuc, D{\ldots}âoil), were substituted for the occasion setters A and B (C{\ldots}x, D{\ldots}x, C{\ldots}y, D{\ldots}y; Experiments 2, 3b and 4). These results could not be explained in terms of Pavlovian summation: responding to combinations of Pavlovian CSs paired with same or different outcomes was either the same, or lower when both stimuli had been paired with the same outcome (Experiment 4). Implications of these results for theories of occasion setting and configural learning are discussed.},

abstract = {An association between a cue and an outcome will generalize to a similar novel cue to some extent, but not completely. Learning theorists refer to the discrepancy between responding elicited by the original cue and the novel cue as a generalization decrement. Two experiments used a contingency learning task with human participants to compare the size of a generalization decrement between configurations of cues that were altered by adding or subtracting compositional elements. The results suggest that adding elements to a configuration can produce a generalization decrement, but removing elements produces a more robust generalization decrement. Furthermore, the generalization decrement caused by adding elements was not likely to be caused by competing orienting responses. The results are used to contrast Pearce's (1987, 1994) and Wagner's (2003) models of stimulus generalization.},
